\arguments{
\item{model}{logistic regression model}
}
\value{
odds of coefficients of independent variables in logistic model
}
\description{
Logistic regression model's coefficients give the change in the log odds of the outcome for a one unit increase in the predictor variable. So covert log odds to odds, and also compute 95% confidence interval using standard errors.
